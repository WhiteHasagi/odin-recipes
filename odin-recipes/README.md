# odin-recipes
Hello, today I, the big Asian will try to understand how to do an
odin project.
My goal is to see what I can achieve.If I never tried, I never know.
I may not be good in English but that does not mean I am good at coding.
I may be terrible at beggining but everyone gotta start from somewhere.
No one born and know how to walk
No one see Java code and instatnly become talent by it
(Except those Minecraft player who master C++ and Java through command
in the game)
Anyway, I will try to figure out what this project will lead me to.
